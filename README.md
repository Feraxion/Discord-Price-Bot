# Discord Price Bot

This Discord bot fetches price data from an API and updates its nickname in all the servers it's a member of to display the fetched price. The bot checks for price updates and changes its nickname every minute.

## Prerequisites

To run this bot, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the code.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

3. Create a new Discord bot:

   a. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

   b. Click the "New Application" button.

   c. Give your application a name and click "Create".

   d. Navigate to the "Bot" tab on the left side of the page and click "Add Bot".

   e. Copy the bot token by clicking on "Copy" under the "Token" section.

4. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following content:

   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here

   Replace `your_bot_token_here` with the bot token you copied in step 3e.

5. Invite the bot to your server:

   a. In the Discord Developer Portal, navigate to the "OAuth2" tab.

   b. In the "Scopes" section, select "bot".
